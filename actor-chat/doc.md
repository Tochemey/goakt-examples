This is a very basic example to demonstrate how remoting and `RemoteForward` works.
To run it follow this steps:

1. go to the server package and run `go run .` on one terminal
2. open two other terminals and run on each of them `go run .`. 
You will observe that message sent from one terminal will appear on the other one.
